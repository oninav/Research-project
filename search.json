    "text": "Motivation Behind the Project\n\n\nFitness data reflecting exercise patterns, body composition, and lifestyle factors offer valuable opportunities for quantitative analysis.\n\nUnderstanding how these factors interact can help reveal key determinants of progress and explain variations in individual performance.\n\nThe project focuses on building statistical and predictive models to detect performance plateaus and forecast outcomes for fitness improvement.\n\nMetrics such as the Resilience Index and Progress Ratio aim to make analytics more interpretable and actionable for individual users.\n\n\n\n\nThe motivation for this project comes from the growing availability of fitness and health data through wearables and tracking apps.\nThese data capture not only exercise patterns but also body composition changes, activity levels, and lifestyle variables like sleep or nutrition.\nHowever, most analyses stop at simple summaries — averages or total steps — without explaining why performance improves or stagnates.\nBy studying how these factors interact statistically, we can uncover key drivers of improvement and individual variability in progress.\nThe project applies advanced statistical and predictive modeling to identify when a user might be hitting a plateau, or how their performance trajectory is evolving.\nTwo proposed metrics — the Resilience Index and Progress Ratio — are designed to make these analyses personalized and interpretable, turning raw numbers into meaningful feedback for users.\nOverall, the goal is to move from descriptive tracking to predictive, actionable insight for fitness improvement."

This directly informs RQ1, where we assess the causal effect of workout consistency on body fat percentage.\nMSMs are chosen over GEEs because they allow causal interpretation by weighting observations based on treatment assignment probabilities, thus restoring exchangeability over time.
